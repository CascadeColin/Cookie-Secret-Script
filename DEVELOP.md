# DEVELOPMENT AREAS

## Sorted by approximate priority

*) TODO: Hook up userfs.json to an inquirer prompt that uses autocomplete and fuzzy to make accessing directories easier for users
    - work already started in fs-inquirer.js
    - SEE: inquirer-autocomplete and fuzzy docs for more info
*) TODO: Implement automated MVC paradigm directory creation at user-specified PATH
*) TODO: Research ChatGPT and OpenAI to find out feasibility of creating README descriptions automatically
*) Create prompts for the Setup Wizard (setup.js).  These prompts include: set default PATH for searching, defaults to answers for main app inquirer questions, creation of custom directory paradigms (auto-create a folder structure other than default MVC)
*) Implement filtering of specified directory names that are undesirable for accessing (i.e. node_modules, .git)
*) Set up the app to take in custom filtering (as specified by users)
